# üå§Ô∏è Style-IN: Weather-Based Outfit Recommendation Web App

**Style-IN** is a smart and aesthetically pleasing web application that recommends outfits based on weather conditions. Built from scratch with a blend of **Machine Learning, Flask, HTML/CSS, and creativity**, this project reflects not just technical skills but also personal expression and usability.

## Project Objective

We often wake up wondering: *‚ÄúWhat should I wear today?‚Äù*  
Style-IN solves this by using weather data (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) to **predict the type of weather** (sunny, rainy, winter, autumn, or spring) and then suggests **a curated set of outfits** ‚Äî all presented on a visually dynamic and responsive web page.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ Machine Learning-based **weather type prediction**
- ‚úÖ Dynamic **HTML page rendering** based on model output
- ‚úÖ Aesthetic, clean **frontend UI** (cards, background images, parallax section)
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout with outfit images tailored to weather conditions
- ‚úÖ Clean folder structure following full-stack project best practices

## Tech Stack Used

| Tech            | Purpose                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Python**      | Core logic and ML model training        |
| **Flask**       | Web framework for routing & rendering   |
| **Scikit-learn**| ML model: RandomForestClassifier        |
| **HTML/CSS**    | Responsive frontend and outfit pages    |
| **NumPy**       | Input preparation for ML prediction     |
| **VS Code**     | IDE used to build and test the project  |

## How It Works

1. The user enters temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
2. The trained ML model (Random Forest) predicts the weather type.
3. Flask then dynamically loads the corresponding outfit suggestion page.
4. Each page has thoughtfully designed outfit cards with styled images.

## Dataset Used
A synthetic dataset was manually generated to simulate weather conditions. It includes columns for temperature, humidity, and wind speed along with a target weather label. The dataset was used to train a RandomForestClassifier model to predict the appropriate weather category.
